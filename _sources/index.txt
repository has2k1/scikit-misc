Onelib
======

Onelib is collection of scientific algorithms missing from scipy.
At some point some of the procedures were present in scipy in an
unstable form, hence their removal. These procedures have been
cleaned up some and the code made more stable. Please report issues
and file corrections `at <https://github.com/has2k1/onelib>`_.
